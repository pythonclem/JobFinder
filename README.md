# Job Finder

**`Automating Job Searches to Find the Perfect Opportunity`**
   </br>

## ðŸ“œ The Why
Finding the perfect opportunity in an ocean of job posts is hard. You need an opportunity youâ€™re passionate about, with the right experience requirement, the right technologies, not to mention the fact that many job posts require Dutch - en ik ben Nederlands aan het leren - but Iâ€™m not comfortable saying I know enough Dutch to work in Dutch. I was also told that knowing how to scrape is generally very useful, and it was a good opportunity to brush up my Python skills.

## ðŸ“œ The What
Job Finder is a python scraping script for Linkedin and Indeed. It takes job titles as inputs, fetches the job posts, and builds a ChatGPT prompt to fish out the main requirements hiding somewhere in the job post. Experience requirements, technologies, and languages. It then outputs ChatGPTâ€™s reply in an excel file, and it allows me to look at more job posts than I ever could if I did it manually.

## ðŸ“œ The How
Job Finder leverages Pyppeteer, which is Puppeteer ported to Python. It can open a browser, run a search, and go post by post to extract the core and save it in an excel file. The scraping itself takes a few precautions like sleep times between clicks, and generally is designed to take a slow approach and not scrape robotically like mad. 

Iâ€™ve also integrated Pyppeteer-Stealth that allows me to manipulate the headers of the requests to try and, well, be stealthy about it. Iâ€™ve also set up a Google Cloud VM and installed Squid to make the requests go through a proxy, because I wanted some hands on experience configuring a proxy.

## ðŸ“œ The Challenges
Learning Pyppeteer was an experience, as HTML and CSS arenâ€™t really something Iâ€™ve focused on before. Scraping can be finicky, so getting it to work just right took a minute. Also, the integration with ChatGPTâ€™s API wasnâ€™t the easiest, as I wasnâ€™t getting the responses I was hoping for. Luckily, after a quick prompt engineering learning session, I started to get exactly what I was looking for.

## ðŸ“œ The Lessons
This project came to me as I was lamenting the inefficiencies of the job hunt and realized I have the power to do something about it. I had that very thought many times since. Pick up some skills, and go for it. The part about the prompt engineering was very beneficial as well. If AI is a tool, knowing how to get the most out of it is a strength. Iâ€™m by no means an expert - but Iâ€™m significantly better at using it than I was before.
